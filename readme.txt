Checklist for Completing Your Healthcare Web Application:
Backend Services:

✔️ Implement data_processing.py, model_inference.py, real_time.py for data handling, model inference, and real-time predictions.
✔️ Define API routes and functionalities in api.py.
✔️ Create config.py for configuration variables.
Frontend Templates:

✔️ Develop HTML templates (index.html, data_analysis.html) for user interface and data visualization.
Flask Application Structure:

✔️ Ensure all backend scripts (data_processing.py, model_inference.py, api.py, config.py) are structured properly within your Flask application directory.
✔️ Place frontend HTML files (index.html, data_analysis.html) in the templates directory.
Integration and Testing:

✔️ Integrate frontend templates with Flask routes (views.py) for rendering HTML content.
✔️ Test backend functionalities (api.py endpoints, model inference) to ensure they work correctly with sample data.
Deployment and Environment Setup:

✔️ Set up virtual environment for your Flask application (virtualenv or conda).
✔️ Configure environment variables in config.py or using .env files for sensitive information.
✔️ Prepare for deployment on a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure) or local server.
Security and Scalability:

✔️ Implement security best practices (e.g., secure API endpoints, input validation).
✔️ Plan for scalability (e.g., database scaling, load balancing) as your application grows.
Additional Considerations:
Database Integration: If your application requires database storage, integrate SQLAlchemy or another database ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) with your Flask application.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization if your application involves user accounts and sensitive data.
Error Handling: Add robust error handling mechanisms in both frontend (JavaScript error handling) and backend (Flask error handlers).
Documentation and Testing: Document your code thoroughly and conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.
Deployment:
Choose a deployment platform (like Heroku, AWS, or Azure) and follow their deployment guides.
Configure environment variables securely for your deployed application.
Test the deployed application thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected in a production environment.
